# Acronyms

These are a list of common acronyms that I've encoutered working here (not saying where).  I often refer new people to this list as it isn't published anywhere by the organization. Some of the ITIL ones can be especially frustrating if you aren't familiar with them (I'm ITIL 2-3 certified)

I plan to make this a web page, but with someone new starting in my group I figured it was about time to get it out on the web - better available now than 'pretty' later.   :-)

README.md isn't really a good place for this... but I'm in a hurry and it is a low priority
